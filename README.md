# Neural_Network_Tricks
Tricking my MNIST neural network using an adversarial approach.

## Goal
Create images that the network cannot recognize using a gradient descent algorithm.

## Other info:
Inspired by [this](https://medium.com/@ml.at.berkeley/tricking-neural-networks-create-your-own-adversarial-examples-a61eb7620fd8)
All the code is my own.

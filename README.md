# Neural_Network_Tricks
Tricking my MNIST neural network using an adversarial approach.

## Goal
Create images that the network cannot recognize using a gradient descent algorithm.
Images look like a number but the network cannot correctly classify them.

I can maybe use these generated images to train the network to be even better.

Inspired by [this](https://medium.com/@ml.at.berkeley/tricking-neural-networks-create-your-own-adversarial-examples-a61eb7620fd8)
All the code is my own.
